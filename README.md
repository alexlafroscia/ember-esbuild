## Project Status

> Not Usable

These packages are not ready for mainstream adoption yet. They're not even ready for risky usage yet!

Please follow along with the [Initial Release milestone](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-esbuild/milestone/1) and [Support Required Babel Behavior](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-esbuild/projects/2) project to get an idea of what is blocking this project from being usable.

# ember-cli-esbuild

Process your Ember files with esbuild

## Compatibility

- Ember.js v3.16 or above
- Ember CLI v2.13 or above
- Node.js v10 or above

## Installation

```
yarn remove ember-cli-babel
ember install ember-cli-esbuild
```

## Usage

This addon serves to replace [ Babel ](https://babeljs.io) with [ esbuild ](https://esbuild.github.io) in your Ember build pipeline. esbuild is considerably faster than Babel and does most of the same things.

With this addon installed and `ember-cli-babel` removed, that's all there is to do!
